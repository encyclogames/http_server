web_server
==========

An basic implementation of  a web server which supports HTTP requests, HTTPS and CGI.

This was done as an assignment for my networks course (15-441) when i studied in 
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 

Since this is more of an assignment for learning, don't expect the server to be robust to 
errors. You are welcome to use this as a means to understand the inner workings of a web 
server though. I have tried to be as verbose as possible when it comes to documenting 
what my code does.

NOTE: this code is incomplete and i am working on it currently to make it feature complete and
also add some form of robustness.
